# Computer-almostunnatended-autosetup
 I (re)install my Windows computers A LOT, so installing the software all the time is very boring. So I made a tool for that, and I don't really know how to call it, so thats why the funny name...



The script in fact only downloads a list containing programs I need, and it downloads and installs them (if possibly in background), this script is used by me about every month (depends, sometimes I need it every single day of a month...) and because of that it will change very often.
